# Task 4 - Responsive Landing Page

Converted an existing desktop-only landing page into a mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries.

## Changes Made:
- Added viewport meta tag.
- Added `box-sizing: border-box` to avoid overflow.
- Made navigation stack vertically on small screens.
- Fixed pre-text to wrap and avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Made buttons and text responsive.

## How Tested:
- Used Chrome DevTools device toolbar to check iPhone, iPad, and laptop screen sizes.
